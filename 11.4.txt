*. Intelligence without Representation

The author uses the example of evolution of intelligence on the earth.
However, that is more likely to be an *uncouscious process*. While AI
is a kind of *intelligent design*. We do make intelligent agent much
faster than the earth did.

I think abstraction is necessary. The author seems not to completely
disagree on abstraction. When we want to solve a problem that
generally apply to many concrete problems, we do need abstraction.

I don't think the man, chair and banana example is a good one. It's
possible that a child also employes something like first-order
representation, like HUNGERY + FOOD -> -HUNGERY, BANANA is FOOD, CHAIR
is SUSTAINABLE. A child who has not known any of these facts still
cannot come up with a plan.

It's a good point that we shouldn't always provide the robot with our
introspection to the world. But it's okay if we want to make something
human-like.

The author's definition on Creature actually means fully autonomous
agent.

If I understand correctly, neural networks and genetic algorithms have
closer performance to the idea described by the author, even though
they still have explicit representations.

Actually I still have a hard time understanding how they could
eliminate representation totally. This was published quite early. Was
there any progress in this direction in AI?
