*. Distributed Intelligence: Overview of the Field and its Application
in Multi-Robot Systems

Behavior architecture may have a good application in collective
domains. Each agent would be simple - they just mind their own
business, but contribute to a shared goal on a higher level.

I don't think classification on goals by being "individual" or
"shared" is a good approach. I would go for "conflicting" or
"neutral". The authors also mentioned that individual goals could be
shared goals from a higher-level perspective.

I think ad-hoc teamwork can be better regarded as collective instead
of cooperative. So, in a collective domain, the agent may not be aware
of others, or simply don't have enough access to communicate with
others.

Task allocation is a good approach. But I think the task can be
generally regarded as a multi-agent MDP problem. So the roles could be
implicit and agents can change their roles implicitly.

Another reason I believe that robots should be considered as
autonomous agents most of the time in this class. Only very few parts
in this paper have concern on the hardware of real robots.

*. Swarmanoid: a novel concept for the study of heterogeneous robotic
swarms

Different from the previous paper, the robots here are heterogeneous.
They have roles, common goals and are aware of others. But the roles
still need to be assigned for same type of robots.

I think "self-assembly" is an interesting idea, which sounds like
robots in anime..

*. Coordinating Hundreds of Cooperative, Autonomous Vehicles in
Warehouses

I don't think that each agent needs to accomplish tasks individually.
As the requests keep coming in, it's possible that an agent changes
its schedule on its way fetching an item. I think this is very similar
to AIM, if we consider pods as coming vehicles, and robots as lanes.
The question is, which pod (vehicle) should be assigned to which robot
(lane) first to get to the sorter (intersection).

A* is not enough for multi-agent path planning. They can simply let
agents stop to avoid collision though, if they don't consider the time
of congestoin.

I think concurrency is a problem in multi-agent system. It's a general
problem in distributed systems.

Regarding their design of control system, I think 3T can be
generalized for multi-agent system. The Goal in planner can ask
different agents to run different sequencer.

== Summary ==

*. Distributed Intelligence: Overview of the Field and its Application
in Multi-Robot Systems

Domains can be devided into categories of collective, cooperative,
collaboraive and coordinative, depending on awareness of others, type
of goals and whether the environment is adversarial.

There are several approaches. 1) Bioinspired, which is very close to
behavior architecture. Each agent can have very naive behavior, but
their overall performance is complicated. 2) Organizational, in which
roles are defined, which further introduce task allocation problem. 3)
Knowledge-based and/or semantic paradigm.

*. Swarmanoid: a novel concept for the study of heterogeneous robotic
swarms

The author introduce three types of heterogeneous robots: food-robot,
hand-robot and eye-robot. They can cooperate by physical assembly and
other forms of information exchange.
