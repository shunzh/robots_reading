*. Stochastic models, estimation, and control

Compared to deterministic models, probabilistic models win as they are
more tolerant on errors and incompleteness. Would a hybrid model
could have better performance? The agent follows a deterministic
model, which typically does planning, while a probabilistic model
works behind the scene and give advice to the model in the front.

Kalman filter does *incorporate* all data provided, but it actually
uses meta-data (mean, variance), instead of exploiting the data
themselves.

Unlike a general Bayesian filter, we may not require P(x'|x, u)
explicitly for Kalman filter, if the mean and variance of the
probablity distribution can be modeled - this kind of knowledge can be
that the transition would be more uncertain in some known cases.. 

The author spoke highly of Kalman filter, while most of the features
he talked about are shared by a common Bayesian Filter. For example, a
Bayesian Filter makes use of the prior knowledge and the current
observation to gain the current belief.

I think it's like hermatic wording to say "the Kalman filter is
optimal with respect to virtually any criterion that makes sense". He
just believes that the criterion that Kalman filter performs badly
doesn't make sense.

I agree that the sensor probability distribution mostly follows
Gaussian distribution. However, it's possible to learn the
distribution model from P(x|z) we have. It can be done by having a bag
of models and finding out which one fits the distribution the best.

I'm not sure about the purpose of "white noise" the author argues. But
it's helpful to keep some non-zero value throughout the distribution,
for the kidnapping situation.

In the example, I think it's a good point to understand the inverse of
variance as confidence, for gaining the new belief.

*. Probabilistic Robotics

For discrete state spaces, we could apply Kalman Filter by making it
continus first by interpolatoin. If we don't want the Gaussian
assumption, Particle filter is more convenient for this discrete
environment.

In the description of linear Guassian Systems, would epsilon be a
function epsilon(x, x')? I don't think it's a random variable
indepedent from the state transition.

I think it's a good point to separate the deterministic part (Ax + Bu)
and stochastic part (epsilon) in the representation.

The intuition on K is that it weights on variance of previous belief
and that of measurement. Just for symmetric, on the right side of the
equation, why there is no C_t on the left side?

If the transition or measurement function is not linear, my intuition
is to change the basis of states to make it as linear as possible.
That is, using f(x) as states such that g and h are more linear.
Taylor expansion is a good thought, but it only works on one point. I
observe that it has a poor performance on fitting the true
distribution (well, expect on white noise..)

*. Stochastic models, estimation, and control

The author started with the reasons why a deterministic model is not
preferred. We cannot model everything perfectly for a system to
follow. Among what we modelled, there could be error. Also, we might
not be given complete information, no matter how we try to model it.

Like a general Bayesian filter, Kalman filter tries to figure out the
hidden state of the system by the prior knowledge and the observed
measurement. The assumption added is that the noises are white and
Gaussian.

The author also gave an example on computation. An important point is
that we weight the previous belief and the measurement according to
their variance. This weighting function is denoted as K.

*. Probabilistic Robotics

The transition probability and measurement probability can be written
in a linear transition way, plus a Guassian random factor.

In the Kalman filter algorithm, we start with updating mean and
varance by linear transformation. We also put a variance factor on the
old variance. After that, we update them with the measurement by
considering how much the measurement should be incorporated.

The Extended Kalman Filter deals with the situation that the
transition or measurement function is non-linear - which is usually
the case. It uses Taylor Expansion at the point of mean value, to make
the function linear. I just skimmed the following sections. The author
makes use of mean and sigma points to derive a Gaussian distribution.
