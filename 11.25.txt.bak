*. Why the Future Doesn't Need Us

"First let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in
developing intelligent machines that can do all things better than
human beings can do them."
So they can make better robots than we do, which, recursively..

"First, that intelligent machines can do our work for us".
"A second dream of robotics is that we will gradually replace
ourselves with our robotic technology, achieving near immortality by
downloading our consciousnesses"
This is a huge jump! The latter one is a challenge on what ego is,
though.

We are not trying making the intelligence of this planet going
forward.  Instead, we are maximizing the utility of our own species.

I think there is no guarantee that the robots won't threaten human,
even given some "creeds" to follow. This is actually a halting
problem. Instead, it's possible to limit the resources that the robots
can get access to.

I don't think this essay is well organized, as the author was writing
this during the night. Actually I didn't read his own story carefully.

*. The Essence of Soccer: Can Robots Play Too?

Robots are not supposed to play soccer in a human-like way. So I think
the Turing test is a sufficient condition.

There is a difference between pre-programmed robots and
autonomous-learned ones. In most of case, they just follow the rules
given by human in the game. So they are not completely "on their own"
in the game.

I would go for taking "rules" as essential for soccer. In this sense,
the utility - making goals, with constraints of rules - can be defined
for robots. Whether the robots want to form a teamwork or not is up to
them, even though I can't see a reason why they do not want to do so.

I agree it's a good idea to build heterogeneous robots, as there could
be compromise when designing the features of one robot.

I don't know whether "Mixed human-robot teams" can serve as a good
transition. Can human and robot communicate efficiently? Human
gestures and expressions contain much information.

As it says, good question makes good science. It doesn't really matter
whether robots can play soccer with human fairly. There are many
interesting questions, also generally applicable to other domains,
that have emerged so far. So robot soccer is a good question.

== Summary ==

*. Why the Future Doesn't Need Us

This is more like a novel, actually. The main idea is that the author
shows his concern that robots may threaten human in the future.

*. The Essence of Soccer: Can Robots Play Too?

The authors discussed whether it's possible to decide a fair way to
let robots play soccer with human. They proposed that rules can be
changed to accomondate both sides. Then the authors discussed on
possible constraints in individual and as a team.

We also need to consider that the rules should be fair on both sides,
even though we are human. There could also be a transition period for
human players to get comfortable with this.
