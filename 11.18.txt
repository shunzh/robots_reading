*. Autonomous driving in urban environments: Boss and the Urban
Challenge 

So the author didn't consider a multi-agent approach. If there are
multiple autonomous vehicles on the road, it's necessary to consider
whether a centralized (like AIM) or distributed system could work
better.

For autonomous driving, one way is using very robotic way - designing
each modules with human experience. Another way is treating this as a
hierachical RL problem.

== Summary ==

*. Autonomous driving in urban environments: Boss and the Urban
Challenge 

The driving task involves multiple challenges.

1) Motion planning. The agent needs to determine the trajectory and
plan to follow that using control theory.

2) Perception. This builds the belief of the surrounding world. It's
quite straightforward to use filtering algorithms here.

3) Mission planning. This makes the vehicle has higher-level
performance, with motion planning and perception. The roads are
represented as a graph, and each node is assigned with values, like in
RL.

4) Behavioral reasoning. It responds to the mission planning, and
considers other vehicles on the road. This involves much planning to
make it have desired behavior.
