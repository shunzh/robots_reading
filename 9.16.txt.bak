== Comments and Questions ==

Is there an assumption in this book that the envrioment is known? So
we focus on the issue of partial observibility.

It is also emphasized in Sutton's book that the physical body of the
agent is regarded as part of the environment - it responds to the
action.

The author's definition of completeness of states can conclude Markov
property.

I think control is different from action. If the fact is that when the
robot sends 1m/s to its motors, it always runs at 2m/s. 1m/s is the
action and 2m/s is the control. The control defined in this book does
care about the response from the environment (using odometers, in the
example).

In Bayes filtering algorithm, bel(x_t) with bar is what we can get
without any observation. After that, we want to bias it with the
observation and get bel(x_t). I don't think the author make it clear
that in Table 2.1, step 4, we are computing p(z_t, x_t) for every x_t,
and normalize it with the sum of them.

There is a trade-off between making a state more complete by
considering more features (or variables used in states), and losing
Markov property when eliminating features.

The author mentions that Bays filters are found robust in application.
Is the reason simply that it can forget the noise in the history?

== Summary ==

The author starts by giving some instructions on probability. He
identifies the probability part in robotics - it's not realistic for a
robot to have complete observation of the envrioment.

The author uses the term state to characterize the environment. Then
he defines a state representation to be complete if it gives the robot
enough information to predict the future. A robot can retreive
information from information by sensor, and changes its state by
control.

The states, denoted as x, are hidden. It can be infereced by
measurement and control by the robot. What a robot computed from these
evidence is called belief. The author uses a dynamic Bayes
network to describe this. Then he describes the Bayes filter
algorithm to compute the belief.

The author ends up with the implementation staff. There is a trade-off
between efficiency and accuracy.
