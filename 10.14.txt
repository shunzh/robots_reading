*. Omnidirectional Walking Using ZMP and Preview Control for the NAO
Humanoid Robot

I think the Walk Provider in Figure 2 can be clearer if drawn
hiarachically. The control is compuated from controller down to the
inverse kinematics.

The main issue here is to balance the robot when it's walking. This is
dealt with in equation (3), which combines the preview gain and the
ZMP. After that the author moves on the kinematics computation.
Actually, how is equation (3) justified? Would simply multifying the
gain and p_ref be sufficient?

I'm not sure about their methods determining delta-theta, which is the
desired amount of perturbation in each joint..

== Summary ==

*. Omnidirectional Walking Using ZMP and Preview Control for the NAO
Humanoid Robot

In S Frame, steps are computed based on CoM - it has a constant offset
from the CoM.  F Frame determines the trajectory of moving foot. C
Frame finally gives the joints control information. I frame computes
the CoM to keep the robot balanced.

The zero moment point is used to balance the robot when taking an
action. Intuitively, when it's going ahead, the model suggests
positioning the robot backward.

Then the author takes both motion control and balance control in to
consideration and gets equation (2).
